Below is a **structured, end-to-end workflow and performance framework** you can directly use to **enhance the platform architecture, define frontend routing, and align team operations with sales success**. I am presenting this as a **product + system design document**, not code, so it can guide both engineering and operations.

---

## 1. Core Platform Workflow (User → Deal → Approval)

### 1.1 Authentication Flow (Frontend Routes)

**Purpose:** Control access and user state.

**Routes**

* `/login`
* `/register`
* `/verify-account`
* `/dashboard`

**Workflow**

1. User registers
2. Email/phone verification
3. Successful verification → access marketplace
4. Unverified users are restricted from requesting deals

---

## 2. Marketplace & Property Deal Flow

### 2.1 Marketplace Listing

**Route:** `/marketplace`

Each **Property Card** contains:

* Property image
* Location
* Price
* Status (Available / Reserved / Expired)
* Deal Initiator (DI) summary badge

---

### 2.2 Property Details Page

**Route:** `/property/:id`

**Displayed Information**

* Full property details
* Deal Initiator (DI) Info:

  * Full name
  * Phone number (click-to-call)
  * Email
  * Rank (Bronze / Silver / Gold)
* Agent assigned (if any)

**Primary CTA**

* **Request Property**

---

## 3. Payment & Reservation Logic

### 3.1 Request → Payment Modal

When user clicks **Request Property**:

* Payment component pops up
* User completes payment successfully

### 3.2 Reservation Timer Logic

After successful payment:

* Property status = **Reserved**
* **12-hour countdown starts**
* Timer visible on:

  * Property card
  * DI dashboard
  * Admin dashboard

**Business Rule**

* Within 12 hours:

  * Deal Initiator must **claim**
  * Agent must initiate documentation
* If expired:

  * Property auto-reverts to Available
  * Performance penalty applies

---

## 4. Deal Claim & Approval Workflow

### 4.1 Deal Initiator (DI) Claim

**Route:** `/di/deals`

DI actions:

* Claim deal
* Contact agent
* Upload preliminary documentation

**Failure Condition**

* If DI does not claim before expiration → **Poor Performance flag**

---

### 4.2 Agent Role & Communication

**Key Rule:**
Agents **do NOT see buyer details** directly.

**Agent Capabilities**

* Communicate only with Deal Initiator
* Handle:

  * Verification
  * Documentation
  * Consultation
* Update job status

---

### 4.3 Admin Approval

**Route:** `/admin/deals`

Admin responsibilities:

* Review documentation
* Approve or reject deal
* Finalize deal closure
* Release commissions

---

## 5. Performance & Trust Scoring System

This is critical for **platform intelligence and growth control**.

---

## 6. Agent Performance Matrix (Trust Score = 100%)

**Metrics (Equal Weight)**

| Metric        | Description                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Verification  | Successful user verification        |
| Documentation | Accurate & timely document handling |
| Active Jobs   | Number of active deals              |
| Consultation  | Client interaction quality          |

**Formula**

```
Trust Score (%) =
(Verification + Documentation + Active Jobs + Consultation) / 4
```

**Purpose**

* Controls agent visibility
* Determines eligibility for high-value deals
* Influences system trust ranking

---

## 9. Sales Force Storytelling Framework

Each department must understand **how the product sells itself**.

### Product Story (Sales Force)

1. User pain (property access)

3. Trusted agents & DI ranks
4. Secure payment
5. Time-bound accountability
6. Admin-verified closure

---

### Success Stage Workflow (Sales Enablement)

1. Lead acquisition
2. Property request
3. Payment
4. DI claim

6. Admin approval
7. Deal closed → earnings released

## 10. Frontend Routing Alignment Summary

| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Login/Register   | `/login`, `/register` |
| Marketplace      | `/marketplace`        |
| Property Details | `/property/:id`       |
| Payment Modal    | Component-based       |
| DI Dashboard     | `/di/dashboard`       |
| Agent Dashboard  | `/agent/dashboard`    |

---

## 11. Platform Enhancement Outcome

This system ensures:

* Accountability through timers
* Trust via performance scoring
* Sales alignment across departments
* Clear frontend routing logic
* Scalable marketplace governance

---

If you want, next I can:

* Convert this into **API contracts**
* Design **database schemas**
* Map **React route guards**
* Build **performance score formulas in code**
* Or transform this into an **investor-ready product workflow diagram**

State your next priority.
